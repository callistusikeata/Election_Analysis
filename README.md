# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit

The purpose of this project was to complete an election analysis of a local congressional election. These includes:

1. Calculating the total number of votes.
2. Completing the list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculating the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculating the percentage of votes won by each candidate.
5. Determining the winner of the election based on popular vote. 

### The Data

The data includes three columns: ballot ID, county, and candidate name.

## Election Audit Results

The total amount of votes in the election was 369,711. Denver received the highest votes during the election, winning 82.8% of the total votes. Jefferson won 10.5% of the total votes, while Arapahoe won 6.7% of the total votes.

The candidates, Diana DeGette received the highest votes, which was 73.8% of all votes or 272,892 votes. The second-place candidate, Charles Casper Stockham, received 23% of the total votes, while the third candidate, Raymon Anthony Doane, received the lowest vote at 3.1% of the overall votes. 

## Election Audit Summary

This script can be adjusted to find the greatest number of votes using other filters like candidates, county, demographics etc.

This script can also be adjusted to determine patterns among the characteristics. For example, test the percentage of voters by county against each candidate. This would let us see which candidate was the most popular within a geographical area.
