# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit

The purpose of this project was to complete an election analysis of a local congressional election. These includes:

1. Calculating the total number of votes.
2. Completing the list of candidates who received votes.
3. Calculating the total number of votes each candidate received.
4. Calculating the percentage of votes won by each candidate.
5. Determining the winner of the election based on popular vote. 

### The Data

The data includes three columns: ballot ID, county, and candidate name.

## Election Audit Results

The total amount of votes in the election was 369,711. Denver received the highest votes during the election, winning 82.8% of the total votes. Jefferson won 10.5% of the total votes, while Arapahoe won 6.7% of the total votes.

The candidates, Diana DeGette received the highest votes, which was 73.8% of all votes or 272,892 votes. The second-place candidate, Charles Casper Stockham, received 23% of the total votes, while the third candidate, Raymon Anthony Doane, received the lowest vote at 3.1% of the overall votes. 

## Election Audit Summary

This script can be modified to find the greatest number of votes for different filters other than candidates and county. If the data included other characteristics, such as demographics and geography, the script can be modified to include these characteristics and the analysis can be broken down even further.

This script can also be modified to determine patterns among the characteristics. We could test the percentage of voters by county against each candidate. This would allow us to see which candidate was the most popular within a county or geographical area.
